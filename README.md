# âš¡My dotfiles!

This repo includes some fancy and useful coding tools that I use in my daily programming. Let me introduce them briefly to you.

[fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch?tab=readme-ov-file): Similar to `neofetch`, but much faster.

[fish](https://fishshell.com/): A smart and user-friendly command line shell for my `Arch Linux`.

[kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/): A terminal emulator alternative to WezTerm. [Now it supports the cursor trail animation](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/7970).

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/): I mainly use Obsidian with `git` to write my course essays and other fragments, as well as to prepare for my master's dissertation.

[pwsh](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell): A more powerfull alternative to `cmd`.

[rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi): A handy tool to launch applications.

[starship](https://github.com/starship/starship): I use it to config my CLI prompt.

[vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A lightweight (compared to IDE like Visual Studio) editor which can be made into an IDE. Though I use [neovim](https://github.com/spectrumzero/nvimforzero) most of the time, I still rely on vscode to debug programs.

[wezterm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm): A highly customizable, fast and configurable terminal which can be used on Windows. Much prettier than `Windows terminal`.

[yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi): A terminal file manager like `lf` or `ranger`. But it has a higher startup and browsing speed. It even allows users to preview pdf (assuming you have installed `poppler`) and images (assuming Windows users run `wezterm`)!

I have put my configuration files for these tools in the corresponding directories. I hope it will help you. Enjoy!
