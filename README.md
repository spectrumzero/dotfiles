# âš¡My dotfiles!

This repo includes some fancy and useful coding tools that I use in my daily programming. Let me introduce them briefly to you.

[fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch?tab=readme-ov-file): Similar to `neofetch`, but much faster.

[starship](https://github.com/starship/starship): I use it to config my CLI prompt.

[yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi): A terminal file manager like `lf` or `ranger`. But it has a higher startup and browsing speed. It even allows users to preview pdf (assuming you have installed `poppler`) and images (assuming Windows users run `wezterm`)!

[wezterm](https://github.com/wez/wezterm): A highly customizable, fast and configurable terminal which can be used on Windows. Much prettier than `Windows terminal`.

[pwsh](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell): A more powerfull alternative to cmd.

I have put my configuration files for these tools in the corresponding directories. I hope it will help you. Enjoy!
